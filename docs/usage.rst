Usage Notes
===========
.. warning::
   *fMRIPost-AROMA* includes a tracking system to report usage statistics and errors
   for debugging and grant reporting purposes.
   Users can opt-out using the ``--notrack`` command line argument.


Execution and the BIDS format
-----------------------------
The *fMRIPost-AROMA* workflow takes as principal input the path of the dataset
that is to be processed.
The input dataset is required to be in valid :abbr:`BIDS (Brain Imaging Data
Structure)` format, and it must include at least one T1w structural image and
(unless disabled with a flag) a BOLD series.
We highly recommend that you validate your dataset with the free, online
`BIDS Validator <https://bids-standard.github.io/bids-validator/>`_.

The exact command to run *fMRIPRep* depends on the Installation_ method.
The common parts of the command follow the `BIDS-Apps
<https://github.com/BIDS-Apps>`_ definition.
Example: ::

    fmripost_aroma data/bids_root/ out/ participant -w work/

Further information about BIDS and BIDS-Apps can be found at the
`NiPreps portal <https://www.nipreps.org/apps/framework/>`__.


Command-Line Arguments

.. argparse::
   :ref: fmripost_aroma.cli.parser._build_parser
   :prog: fmripost_aroma
   :nodefault:
   :nodefaultconst:


.. _fs_license:

The FreeSurfer license
----------------------
*fMRIPRep* uses FreeSurfer tools, which require a license to run.

To obtain a FreeSurfer license, simply register for free at
https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/registration.html.

When using manually-prepared environments or singularity, FreeSurfer will search
for a license key file first using the ``$FS_LICENSE`` environment variable and then
in the default path to the license key file (``$FREESURFER_HOME/license.txt``).
If using the ``--cleanenv`` flag and ``$FS_LICENSE`` is set, use ``--fs-license-file $FS_LICENSE``
to pass the license file location to *fMRIPRep*.

It is possible to run the docker container pointing the image to a local path
where a valid license file is stored.
For example, if the license is stored in the ``$HOME/.licenses/freesurfer/license.txt``
file on the host system: ::

    $ docker run -ti --rm \
        -v $HOME/fullds005:/data:ro \
        -v $HOME/dockerout:/out \
        -v $HOME/.licenses/freesurfer/license.txt:/opt/freesurfer/license.txt \
        nipreps/fmripost_aroma:latest \
        /data /out/out \
        participant \
        --ignore fieldmaps

.. _prev_derivs:

Reusing precomputed derivatives
-------------------------------

Reusing a previous, partial execution of *fMRIPost-AROMA*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*fMRIPost-AROMA* will pick up where it left off a previous execution, so long as the work directory
points to the same location, and this directory has not been changed/manipulated.
Some workflow nodes will rerun unconditionally, so there will always be some amount of
reprocessing.

Using a previous run of *FreeSurfer*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*fMRIPost-AROMA* will automatically reuse previous runs of *FreeSurfer* if a subject directory
named ``freesurfer/`` is found in the output directory (``<output_dir>/freesurfer``).
Reconstructions for each participant will be checked for completeness, and any missing
components will be recomputed.
You can use the ``--fs-subjects-dir`` flag to specify a different location to save
FreeSurfer outputs.
If precomputed results are found, they will be reused.

BIDS Derivatives reuse
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
As of version 23.2.0, *fMRIPost-AROMA* can reuse precomputed derivatives that follow BIDS Derivatives
conventions. To provide derivatives to *fMRIPost-AROMA*, use the ``--derivatives`` (``-d``) flag one
or more times.

This mechanism replaces the earlier, more limited ``--anat-derivatives`` flag.

.. note::
   Derivatives reuse is considered *experimental*.

This feature has several intended use-cases:

  * To enable fMRIPost-AROMA to be run in a "minimal" mode, where only the most essential
    derivatives are generated. This can be useful for large datasets where disk space
    is a concern, or for users who only need a subset of the derivatives. Further
    derivatives may be generated later, or by a different tool.
  * To enable fMRIPost-AROMA to be integrated into a larger processing pipeline, where
    other tools may generate derivatives that fMRIPost-AROMA can use in place of its own
    steps.
  * To enable users to substitute their own custom derivatives for those generated
    by fMRIPost-AROMA. For example, a user may wish to use a different brain extraction
    tool, or a different registration tool, and then use fMRIPost-AROMA to generate the
    remaining derivatives.
  * To enable complicated meta-workflows, where fMRIPost-AROMA is run multiple times
    with different options, and the results are combined. For example, the
    `My Connectome <https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds000031/>`__ dataset contains
    107 sessions for a single-subject. Processing of all sessions simultaneously
    would be impractical, but the anatomical processing can be done once, and
    then the functional processing can be done separately for each session.

See also the ``--level`` flag, which can be used to control which derivatives are
generated.

Troubleshooting
---------------
Logs and crashfiles are output into the
``<output dir>/fmripost_aroma/sub-<participant_label>/log`` directory.
Information on how to customize and understand these files can be found on the
`Debugging Nipype Workflows <https://miykael.github.io/nipype_tutorial/notebooks/basic_debug.html>`_
page.
