What is fMRIPost?
-----------------

fMRIPost workflows are BIDS Apps that ingest fMRI preprocessing derivative datasets.
They fall under the broader umbrella of NiPost workflows,
which are pipelines that perform post-processing on BIDS-Derivative datasets.

These workflows are primarily tested against the outputs of the `fMRIPrep`_ pipeline,
but we plan to ensure that they can work with derivatives from any pipeline that produces BIDS-Derivative compliant datasets.
