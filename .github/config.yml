  :wave: Welcome, and thank you for your first contribution!

  We ask you to take a moment to read through our Contributing Guide:

  :point_right: https://github.com/nipreps/fmripost-template/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md

  These guidelines help us maintain a consistent and collaborative workflow.
  But don't worry — you don't have to get everything perfect on the first try!

  :mag: Here are a few quick tips:

  1. **Start a conversation**: Consider opening an issue to discuss your idea
     before submitting a pull request. It might save you time.
  1. **Descriptive titles**: Please use a clear, descriptive title for your
     pull request. If it is still a work in progress, mark it as a "Draft".
  1. **Licensing**: All contributions will be licensed under the Apache 2.0
     license — the same as the rest of the project.
  1. **Authorship**: You're invited to add yourself to the `.zenodo.json` file.
     file. This will credit you as a co-author in the next release. Please add
     your name as the second-to-last entry, just above the last author.

  A pull request is a conversation. We may suggest changes before merging,
  and likewise, you should feel free to ask us any questions you have.

  :rocket: We're happy to have you here!
